# Syntax Squad: Career Prediction Model

Welcome to the Syntax Squad Career Prediction Model!  
This project was developed in just 8 hours during a hackathon by a passionate team aiming to help students and young professionals discover their ideal career paths using machine learning.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Syntax Squad leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to predict the most suitable career for users based on their academic background, skills, preferences, and personal attributes.  
The model is trained on a diverse dataset and supports interactive predictions via a user-friendly web interface.
